# Real-Science-RQH-CRL-Heliotron v3.1.2
A self-contained bootstrap of the Causal-Residual Ledger and theoretical heliotron pipeline.

Made for copy-and-pasting into A.I sessions, either paste multiple sections or upload the file.

Combine with V1.5H to operate from canonical sprite data.

Ask A.I to make a spark event!

Enjoy!
